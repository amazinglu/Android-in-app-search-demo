use search widget
add custom query suggestion
/**

to implements App specific suggestion -> use custom Content provider
base idea:
content provider query the suggestion database and return the result to searchable activity using intent
define the content provider
we need to let the system knows which provider is used for generate search suggestion and
which intent is used to send the suggestion back to searchable activity
see "suggest" related definition in searchable.xml and provider xml in Manifest
the authorities see be the same in searchable.xml and Manifest
get the origin query the user input
the query is sent in a uri form to the content provider, which is:
content://your.authority/optional.suggest.path/SUGGEST_URI_PATH_QUERY
authority: the authority we define for the content provider
optional.suggest.path: the string we define in android:searchSuggestPath in searchable.xml
to get the origin query:
String query = uri.getLastPathSegment().toLowerCase();
search and return the suggestion strings
search is the place we can DIY
build the suggestion strings:
must format the suggestions as rows in a table and present them with a Cursor. Need to use specific
columns that the system can understand
searchable activity do sth when user click the suggestion
we can use SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA, SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_DATA_ID and SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_EXTRA_DATA
to return send data from content provider to searchable activity
